packages:
- xsel # particularly relevant for copying and pasting out of emacs
- pwgen # password generator
- jq # programming language useful for json parsing hacks
- sqlite3 # database, motivated currently by firefox configuration
- tree-sitter-cli # parser tool which integrates with emacs package for yaml (zkry/yaml-pro in particular)
- tree-sitter-dev # actually perhaps this is what I need here
